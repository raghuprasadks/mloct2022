Assignment:

1. Following advertisement is put in a shopping mall.

Welcome to year end sales....
purchase upto 10000 and get discount of 10 % purchase_amt<=10000
purchase upto 20000 and get discount of 20 % purchase_amt>10000 <=20000
purchase above 20000 and get discount of 30 %. purchase_amt>20000

Write a python program to find the discount and net amount
to pay.. 
Sample calculation

purchase_amount = 5000
discount = 5000*10/100=500
net_amount = purchase_amout - discount
	   = 5000-500 = 4500

Solution to assignment:
https://github.com/raghuprasadks/mloct2022

option 1 - without using function
purchase_amount = 5000
discountrate = 0
discount =0
netamount = 0
if (purchase_amount <=10000):
  discountrate=.1
elif (purchase_amount >10000 and purchase_amount<=20000):
  discountrate=.2
else:
  discountrate=.3
discount = purchase_amount * discountrate
netamount = purchase_amount - discount
print ("You have to pay ",netamount)
print ("Your saving on this bill is  ",discount)


option 2 - with using function
def shopping(purchase_amount):
  discountrate = 0
  discount =0
  netamount = 0
  if (purchase_amount <=10000):
    discountrate=.1
  elif (purchase_amount >10000 and purchase_amount<=20000):
    discountrate=.2
  else:
    discountrate=.3
  discount = purchase_amount * discountrate
  netamount = purchase_amount - discount
  print ("You have to pay ",netamount)
  print ("Your saving on this bill is  ",discount)


calling a function
shopping(10000)

option 3 - with user input

name = input ("enter your name")
print ("your name is ",name)

mobile = input ("enter your mobile number")
print ("your mobile number is ",mobile)
print ("data type of mobile ",type(mobile))

purchase_amt = int(input("enter purchase amount"))
shopping(purchase_amt)
